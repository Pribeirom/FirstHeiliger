What do I want in the game?

>Should be single player
>Missions (Campaign) and Custom Missions (Skirmish)
>Based in Combat
>Highly customizable ships, lots of parts, chassis, weapons, etc.
>Player should be a "pilot" independent of the ships, so it can maintain a log file with achievements and stats
>Player can own multiple ships
>Game currency highly usable too, for player to buy and sell parts and ships.
